    - Asset
        - a logical unit of data such as a table, dataset, or machine learning model
        - can have dependencies on other assets
        - can interact with many other Dagster entities
        - the definition is automatically added to a top-level Definitions object
        - deep dive - https://dagster.io/blog/software-defined-assets
        - relationships
            - is described by an asset spec
            - may be programmatically built by a component
            - is added to a top-level Definitions object to be deployed
            - may use an asset check, a config, an io manager, a partition, a resource
            - may be used in a job, a schedule, a sensor
    - Asset check
        - ensures an asset meets certain expectations around data quality, freshness or completeness
        - relationships
            - may be used by an asset
            - is added to a top-level Definitions object to be deployed
    - Asset spec
        - standalone objects that describe the identity and metadata of Dagster entities without defining their behavior

        - relationships
            - must contain at least one top-level Definitions object
    - Component

- [x] https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-basics-tutorial
    - programming model is built around Assets, which are organized within Definitions.
        - Definitions act as containers for all Dagster entities in your project.
        - Assets represent the entities in the data platform, while the dependencies between them define the project’s lineage.
- [x] https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-basics-tutorial/projects
    - `create-dagster project project-name` - to scaffold a package containing a Dagster Definitions object
    - `dg dev` to launch project locally at http://127.0.0.1:3000
- [x] https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-basics-tutorial/assets
    - primary building blocks
    - represent the underlying entities in our pipelines, such as database tables, machine learning models, or AI processes
    - example scaffolding command `dg scaffold defs dagster.asset assets.py`
    - next define an asset using the @dg.asset
    - `dg check defs` - to check that the Definitions object can be loaded without error as new Dagster objects are added
    - materialize assets
        - using ui
        - using cli
            - all assets `dg launch --assets "*"`
            - specific assets `dg launch --assets customers,orders,payments`
- [x] https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-basics-tutorial/resources
    - Resources are Dagster objects much like assets, but they are not executed
    - resources are reusable objects that supply external context, such as database connections, API clients, or configuration settings
    - example scaffolding command `dg scaffold defs dagster.resources resources.py`
    - example defines the DuckDB resource
    - a resources function is decorated with the @dg.definitions
    - updating assets to use the resource
        - set the resource as a parameter in each asset, its name matches the key that was set when defining the resource. 
- [x] https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-basics-tutorial/dependencies
    - To link the assets together, set the `deps` parameter within the asset decorator.
- [x] https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-basics-tutorial/asset-checks
    - define a function and decorate it with the @dg.asset_check
        - Within the asset check, set the asset parameter to indicate which asset the check runs against.
    - use dg.AssetCheckResult to set if check has passed and additional metadata
- [x] https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-basics-tutorial/schedules
    - There are several ways to automate assets in Dagster: scheduled and event-driven pipelines
    - schedules exist within the Definitions layer
    - example scaffolding command `dg scaffold defs dagster.schedule schedules.py`
    - Schedules consist of a cron_schedule and target
- [x] https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-basics-tutorial/custom-components
    - Components generate Definitions through a configuration layer (helps avoid duplications)
    - There are built-in components
    - example scaffolding command `dg scaffold component Tutorial`
    - The first step is to create a dg.Model for the ETL assets.
        - dg.Model turns any class that inherits from it into a Pydantic model
        - This model will contain the attributes that define an asset
    - Next, add the interface to the dg.Component class
    - In build_defs method construct a Definitions object containing the Dagster objects
    - Now following command can be used to scaffold definitions `dg scaffold defs dagster_tutorial.components.tutorial.Tutorial tutorial`
        - update the YAML file created when you scaffolded a definition from the component
            - type - component class
            - attributes - contains parameters described in the component interface
