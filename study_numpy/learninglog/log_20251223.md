    - provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays
    - At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object.
    - important differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences
        - NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation
            - Changing the size will create a new array and delete the original
        - The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type and size
        - NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data
        - A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are using NumPy arrays and they often output NumPy arrays
    - two improtant NumPy’s features - vectorization and broadcasting
        - Vectorization describes the absence of any explicit looping, indexing, etc., in the Python code (by using pre-compiled C code instead).
        - Broadcasting is the term used to describe the implicit element-by-element behavior of operations
            - in NumPy all operations, not just arithmetic operations, but logical, bit-wise, functional, etc., broadcast

    - NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. Its elements are indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.
    - In NumPy dimensions are called axes.
    - important attributes of an ndarray object
        - ndarray.ndim
            - the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.
        - ndarray.shape
            - a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. The length of the shape tuple is the number of axes, ndim.
        - ndarray.size
            - the total number of elements of the array.
        - ndarray.dtype
            - an object describing the type of the elements in the array.
        - ndarray.itemsize
            - the size in bytes of each element of the array.
        - ndarray.data
            - the buffer containing the actual elements of the array.
    - ways to create numpy array
        - .array
        - .zeros
        - .zeros_like
        - .ones
        - .ones_like
        - .empty
        - .empty_like
        - .arange
        - .linspace
        - .random.Generator.random
        - .random.Generator.normal
        - .fromfunction
        - .fromfile
    - to force NumPy to print the entire (large) array, you can change the printing options using np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)
    - Arithmetic operators on arrays apply elementwise
        - A new array is created and filled with the result.
    - The matrix product can be performed using the @ operator
    - Some operations, such as += and *=, act in place to modify an existing array rather than create a new one.
    - When operating with arrays of different types, the type of the resulting array corresponds to the more general or precise one
    - One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over
    - Multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis
    - When fewer indices are provided than the number of axes, the missing indices are considered complete slices `:`
        - The dots (...) represent as many colons as needed to produce a complete indexing tuple
    - to perform an operation on each element in the array, one can use the .flat attribute which is an iterator 
    - shape of an array can be changed
        - If a dimension is given as -1 in a reshaping operation, the other dimensions are automatically calculated
    - Several arrays can be stacked together along different axes
    - you can split an array along its axis
    - Copies and views
        - Simple assignments make no copy of objects or their data
        - function calls make no copy
        - The view method creates a new array object that looks at the same data.
        - Slicing an array returns a view of it
        - The copy method makes a complete copy of the array and its data
    - Broadcasting rules
        - if all input arrays do not have the same number of dimensions, a "1" will be repeatedly prepended to the shapes of the smaller arrays until all the arrays have the same number of dimensions
        - arrays with a size of 1 along a particular dimension act as if they had the size of the array with the largest shape along that dimension
        - After application of the broadcasting rules, the sizes of all arrays must match.
    - Advanced indexing
        - In addition to indexing by integers and slices, arrays can be indexed by arrays of integers and arrays of booleans.
    - The ix_ function can be used to combine different vectors so as to obtain the result for each n-uplet
    - To change the dimensions of an array, you can omit one of the sizes (using -1) which will then be deduced automatically
    - To construct a 2D array from a list of equally-sized row vectors we use functions column_stack, dstack, hstack or vstack
    - The NumPy histogram function applied to an array returns a pair of vectors: the histogram of the array and a vector of the bin edges.

    - If you want to select values from your array that fulfill certain conditions, it’s straightforward with NumPy. (ex. a[a < 5]) (ex. a[(a > 2) & (a < 11)])
    - You can also make use of the logical operators & and | in order to return boolean values that specify whether or not the values in an array fulfill a certain condition
    - there are several ways to save and load objects with NumPy
        - np.save, np.savez, np.savetxt, np.load, np.loadtxt
