- Prerequisites
    - LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) - An open‑source, high‑performance gradient boosting framework used for supervised machine learning tasks such as classification and regression; it builds models from an ensemble of decision trees.
    - Supervised Learning - A type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data to make predictions. (needed to understand training/predict workflows)
    - Gradient Boosting - An ensemble technique that sequentially builds models (usually decision trees), where each new model corrects errors of previous ones by optimizing a loss function via gradient descent.
    - Decision Trees - A basic predictive model that splits input features based on thresholds to make predictions; used as base learners in LightGBM.
    - Ensemble Learning - Combining multiple machine learning models to improve predictive performance over single models.
    - NumPy arrays - The fundamental numerical array data structure in Python used for efficient computation and as input format for LightGBM datasets.
    - Pandas DataFrame - A tabular data structure in Python often used for handling structured datasets, commonly passed to LightGBM.
    - SciPy Sparse Matrix - An efficient representation of sparse data (mostly zeros), supported by LightGBM for memory‑efficient loading.
    - Dataset Object - A LightGBM class that stores training data in optimized form for training.
    - Model Parameters - Configurable options (like `num_leaves`, `objective`, `metric`) that control how LightGBM models are trained.
    - Training - The process of fitting a LightGBM model to data using functions such as `lgb.train()`.
    - Cross‑Validation (CV) - A method to evaluate model performance by splitting data into folds (e.g., 5‑fold) to reduce overfitting.
    - Early Stopping - A technique to halt training when performance on a validation set stops improving, to prevent overfitting.
    - Prediction - Using a trained LightGBM model to generate outputs for new, unseen data.

    - can load data from:
        - LibSVM (zero-based) / TSV / CSV format text file
        - NumPy 2D array(s), pandas DataFrame, H2O DataTable’s Frame (deprecated), SciPy sparse matrix
        - LightGBM binary file
        - LightGBM Sequence object(s)
    - The data is stored in a Dataset object.
    - Training
        - requires a parameter list and data set
        - after training, the model can be saved or dumped to JSON format
        - a saved model can be loaded
    - Early stopping
        - using one or more validation sets, can use early stopping to find the optimal number of boosting rounds
        - The model will train until the validation score stops improving
        - Validation score needs to improve at least every stopping_rounds to continue training
    - Prediction
        - A model that has been trained or loaded can perform predictions on datasets
        - with early stopping enabled during training, can get predictions from the best iteration with bst.best_iteration
