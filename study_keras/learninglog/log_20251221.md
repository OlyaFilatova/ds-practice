    - To use Keras 3, you will also need to install a backend framework – either JAX, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
        - If you install TensorFlow 2.15, you should reinstall Keras 3 afterwards. The cause is that tensorflow==2.15 will overwrite your Keras installation with keras==2.15
    - configure backend (Available backend options are: "jax", "tensorflow", "torch")
        - export the environment variable KERAS_BACKEND

                or 
        - edit local config file at ~/.keras/keras.json 
        - The backend must be configured before importing Keras

    - Keras 3 is a deep learning framework that works with TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch interchangeably
    - model-building options that Keras offers include:
        - The Sequential API
        - The Functional API
        - Writing your own models yourself via subclassing (for advanced use cases)
    - enables to write custom Layers, Models, Metrics, Losses, and Optimizers
    - models can be trained and evaluated on a wide variety of data sources
        - NumPy arrays
        - Pandas dataframes
        - TensorFlow tf.data.Dataset objects
        - PyTorch DataLoader objects
        - Keras PyDataset objects
- [x] https://keras.io/getting_started/about/
    - The core data structures of Keras are layers and models
- [x] https://keras.io/keras_3/
    - ability to dynamically select the backend that will deliver the best performance for the model without having to change anything in the code
    - Any Keras 3 model can be instantiated as a PyTorch Module, can be exported as a TensorFlow SavedModel, or can be instantiated as a stateless JAX function
