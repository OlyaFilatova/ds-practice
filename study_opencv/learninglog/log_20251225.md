    - an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms
    - available modules
        - a compact module defining basic data structures, including the dense multi-dimensional array Mat and basic functions used by all other modules.
        - an image processing module that includes linear and non-linear image filtering, geometrical image transformations (resize, affine and perspective warping, generic table-based remapping), color space conversion, histograms, and so on.
        - includes functions for reading and writing image files in various formats.
        - an interface to video capturing and video codecs.
        - an interface to simple UI capabilities.
        - a video analysis module that includes motion estimation, background subtraction, and object tracking algorithms.
        - basic multiple-view geometry algorithms, single and stereo camera calibration, object pose estimation, stereo correspondence algorithms, and elements of 3D reconstruction.
        - salient feature detectors, descriptors, and descriptor matchers.
        - detection of objects and instances of the predefined classes (for example, faces, eyes, mugs, people, cars, and so on).
        - Deep Neural Network module.
        - The Machine Learning module includes a set of classes and functions for statistical classification, regression, and clustering of data.
        - advanced photo processing techniques like denoising, inpainting.
        - functions for image stitching and panorama creation.
    - API Concepts
        - All the OpenCV classes and functions are placed into the cv namespace
        - OpenCV handles all the memory automatically
        - uses exceptions to signal critical errors
        - the same function or the same methods of different class instances can be called from different threads

    - Read an image from file (using cv::imread)
    - Display an image in an OpenCV window (using cv::imshow)
    - Write an image to a file (using cv::imwrite)
